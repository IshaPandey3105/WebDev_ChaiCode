# 🚀 Isha Pandey's Web Dev Journey | Chai Code Cohort 🌟

👩‍💻 _A passionate BTech CSE student exploring the world of web development — from frontend design to backend magic._  
✨ This repository is my **learning diary + code vault** where I build, break, and improve my skills — one commit at a time.  
Part of **Chai Code Cohort Batch 1.0**, where I’m sharpening my web dev skills with a community of learners.

## 📌 What this repo contains

📝 This repository documents my journey in:

- 🌐 **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (basics and projects)
- 🎨 **Mini projects:** ToDo app, theme switchers, simple calculators
- 🛠 **Version control:** Practicing Git & GitHub to maintain clean code history

## 📂 Folder structure

/html-css-practice → My foundational work in HTML + CSS
/bootstrap-experiments → Bootstrap components, dark/light theme, responsiveness
/javascript-basics → JS syntax, DOM manipulation, ES6+ features
/mini-projects → Small functional apps (ToDo app, calculator, etc.)

## 🔥 Current focus

✅ HTML5 + modern CSS
